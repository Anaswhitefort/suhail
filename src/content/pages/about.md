<Welcome to my world of passion and dedication in the realm of real estate.>

 At the age of 23, I find myself at the helm of a dynamic career as a Senior Portfolio Manager, driven by a fervent desire to excel and create lasting impressions in the real estate landscape.

My journey began in the vibrant city of Mumbai, where I pursued my education after completing schooling in my hometown of Kerala, India. A brief stint at Mumbai International Airport as a food salesperson sparked the realization that my true calling lay elsewhere. Eager to explore new horizons, I transitioned into sales, seizing an opportunity with one of India's unicorn companies as an NRI Sales Executive.

This experience was a turning point, igniting my passion for sales and paving the way for a rewarding career. Seven months of dedicated service at No Broker fueled my enthusiasm, and my journey continued with a move to the prestigious Tech company, Therapy Brands, based in the United States. Embracing the role of Relationship Manager, I thrived in this dynamic environment, solidifying my belief that real estate was where I belonged.

Driven by this realization, I made the bold move to Dubai and joined one of the city's finest real estate firms, REVO REALTY. The months spent with this esteemed organization sharpened my skills and deepened my understanding of the real estate market. Today, I proudly serve as a Senior Portfolio Manager at MOR HOMES REAL ESTATE.

In my current role, I oversee portfolios ranging from first-time buyers to high-net-worth individuals, offering unparalleled services and guiding clients seamlessly through the intricate real estate process. From selling apartments and beachfront penthouses to managing villas, mansions, and plots, I am committed to delivering extraordinary experiences and ensuring that each client's journey is nothing short of exceptional.
